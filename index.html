An aggressive play on the 6th hole (Union) left him reeling for the rest of the tournament. At the post-halfway hole, he attempted to stay in contention with a Long Island chug followed by 3 gummy bear shots. At the next bar, the consequences set in and he had to withdraw from the tournament. Let’s hope this year he learns to lay up.</h4>

Though he can use any club in his bag, he’ll have a strong advantage for the Wine on High hole, where his knowledge and passion for the fermented grape juice will leave competitors in the dust. Jason also brings spirited energy and optimism to the tournament. The other golfers will be sure to appreciate his antics.</h4>

For the portion of holes he attended, his knowledge of golf and sports came in clutch, including a win at Mike’s Grill Trivia. Matt is still a college student, so his drinking skills are not to be overlooked. Analysts are dubbing him a dark horse to finish strong this year, as long as he doesn’t have tickets to anything.</h4>

He has no weakness when it comes to drinking (except that too many ciders will make his tummy hurt, but whose wouldn’t?). His competitors&rsquo; only hope is that this year’s organizers threw in a few surprise events that could stump him.</h4>

His drinking abilites also showed through in the most recent event, the 2024 “drink-the-last-tab”, putting in big work for the 17 green tea at DraftKings. Competitors should look out for his strategic acumen, skills he gained from being a track coach. These skills were on display last year for the Wine on High hole, when he took a tactical nap, giving him the strength to finish strong.</h4>

He recently came up only just short of tackling a rotisserie chicken. Spencer is also one of two competitors (Matt) who has played organized golf. His large stomach and golfing abilities should give him an advantage in a tournament that combines drinking and golf. We’ll see if it’s enough to improve on his finish last year and challenge the favorites.</h4>
